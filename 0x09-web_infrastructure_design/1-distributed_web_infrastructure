Load Balancer Configuration:
The load balancer is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm.
This algorithm evenly distributes incoming requests across the available web servers in a sequential manner.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:
The load balancer enables an Active-Active setup.
In Active-Active, all servers actively handle incoming requests simultaneously,
distributing the load evenly across them. In contrast, Active-Passive involves one server
actively serving requests while the other server remains on standby, only becoming active if the primary server fails.

Database Primary-Replica Cluster:
In a Primary-Replica cluster, the primary node handles write operations,
such as inserting, updating, and deleting data. The replica nodes replicate data
from the primary node and handle read operations, serving read-only queries from clients.

Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes:
The primary node handles write operations and serves as the authoritative source of data for the database.
It processes incoming write requests and ensures data consistency across the cluster.
Replica nodes, on the other hand, replicate data from the primary node and serve read requests.
They provide scalability and fault tolerance by distributing read operations across multiple nodes, enhancing overall database performance.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Points of Failure (SPOFs):
Although we've added redundancy with multiple servers, each component still represents a
potential single point of failure. If any critical component fails, it could disrupt service availability.
				  
Security Issues:
Lack of a firewall and HTTPS encryption introduces security vulnerabilities,
making the infrastructure susceptible to attacks such as DDoS, SQL injection, and data interception.

No Monitoring:
Without monitoring tools in place, it's challenging to detect and respond to performance issues,
security threats, or infrastructure failures in a timely manner. Monitoring is crucial for maintaining the health and reliability of the system.
