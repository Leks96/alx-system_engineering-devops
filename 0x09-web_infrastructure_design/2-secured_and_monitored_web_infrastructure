Specifics:

Why firewalls?:
Firewalls provide an additional layer of security by filtering incoming
and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.
They help prevent unauthorized access and protect against various network-based attacks.

Why HTTPS?:
HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server,
ensuring confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information
such as login credentials, personal data, and payment details.

Purpose of monitoring:
Monitoring is used to track the health, performance, and
availability of the infrastructure components and applications.
It helps identify issues proactively, troubleshoot problems, and optimize performance.

Data collection by monitoring tool:
The monitoring tool collects data from various sources such as system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage),
application logs, network traffic, and user interactions. It aggregates and
analyzes this data to provide insights into the system's behavior and performance.

Monitoring web server QPS (Queries Per Second):
To monitor the web server's QPS, we would configure the monitoring tool to collect metrics related to
incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests and calculate the rate at which these requests are processed over time.

Issues:

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level:
Terminating SSL at the load balancer exposes decrypted traffic within the internal network,
potentially compromising data confidentiality. It's recommended to maintain end-to-end encryption
by encrypting traffic between the load balancer and web servers as well.

Single MySQL server capable of accepting writes:
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting write operations introduces a single point of failure
for database writes. Implementing a primary-replica (master-slave) replication setup would provide redundancy and improve fault tolerance.

Identical server components:
Having servers with identical components may lead to uniform vulnerabilities and dependencies.
Diversifying server configurations can mitigate risks associated with common vulnerabilities and single points of failure.
Additionally, different workload characteristics may require specialized configurations for optimal performance.
