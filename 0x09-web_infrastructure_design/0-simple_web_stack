What is a Server?: 
A server is a computer system or software that provides functionality
to other devices or programs, known as clients, over a network.

What is the role of the domain name?:
The domain name serves as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address.
It allows users to easily access websites without needing to remember complex numerical IP addresses.

What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?:
www is a subdomain, and it's typically represented by a DNS "A" record,
which maps the subdomain to the server's IP address.

What is the role of the web server?:
The web server handles incoming HTTP requests from clients (browsers)
and serves static content like HTML, CSS, and images.
It can also manage dynamic content by passing requests to the application server.

What is the role of the application server?:
The application server executes the server-side code of the website,
generating dynamic content based on user requests.
It interacts with the database to retrieve and store data as needed.

What is the role of the database?:
The database stores and manages structured data for the website.
It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data,
such as user information, product details, and other application data.

What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website?:
The server communicates with the user's computer over the HTTP protocol.
When a user enters the website's URL in their browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server,
and the server responds with the requested web page.

Now, let's address the issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since we have only one server, if it goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible. 
This can result from hardware failure, software issues, or network problems.

Downtime during maintenance:
Any maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or updates, require taking the web server offline.
During this time, the website will be inaccessible to users.

				Limited scalability: With only one server, the infrastructure cannot handle a large influx of incoming traffic efficiently. Scaling the infrastructure to handle increased traffic would require additional servers and load balancing configuration.
